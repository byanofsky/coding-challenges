# regexp tutorial

Build a regular expression engine following the [Let's Build a Regex Engine](https://kean.blog/post/lets-build-regex) tutorial.

This tutorial was linked from the [Build Your Own grep](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-grep) coding challenge as a bonus option.

The outcome of my initial attempt at a regex engine can be found [here](../regexp/go.mod).

Now, I am following this tutorial to understand the "proper" way to build a regex engine.
